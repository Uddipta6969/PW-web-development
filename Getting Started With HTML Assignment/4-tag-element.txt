In HTML, tags and elements are fundamental building blocks used to structure and define the content of a web page

HTML Tag:

An HTML tag is a set of characters enclosed in angle brackets (< >).
Some tags are self-closing, meaning they don't have a separate closing tag. They end with a forward slash (/) just before the closing angle bracket.

Example: 
<head>, <title>, <body>, <a>, <p>

HTML Element:

An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph element</p>
