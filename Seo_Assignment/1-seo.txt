**What is SEO ?
SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a set of strategies and practices aimed at improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs). The primary goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website, thereby attracting more potential customers or visitors. SEO involves various techniques, both on-page and off-page, to optimize a website's content, structure, and overall online presence to make it more appealing to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

2. Cost-Effective Marketing: Compared to paid advertising, SEO can be a cost-effective way to drive organic traffic. Once your site is optimized, it can continue to attract visitors over time without ongoing advertising expenses.

3. Global Reach: SEO allows you to reach a global audience. You can target local or international markets depending on your business goals.

4. Targeted Traffic: SEO allows you to target specific keywords and phrases that are relevant to your business or content. This means that the traffic you attract is more likely to be interested in what you offer, increasing the chances of conversion.
