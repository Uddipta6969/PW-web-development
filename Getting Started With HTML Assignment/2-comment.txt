Comments in HTML serve as a way to include non-rendered, human-readable notes within your HTML code.
They are used to provide explanations, descriptions, or reminders for yourself or other developers who may be working on or reading your HTML code.
Comments are ignored by web browsers and do not affect the appearance or functionality of a web page. 
They are purely for documentation and communication purposes.
